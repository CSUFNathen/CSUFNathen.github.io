### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

The Reason I chose Lab 1 as one of my favorite labs was not because it was easy to do but because it was the beginning of my C++ and Computer Science journey. At that time I was nervous since I was not sure if I could even learn a programming language and this first lab reassured me that I could do it if I put a little effort into it. That was the reason why I choose this Lab since it has some nostalgia and was one of my learning experience with writing code.

* Lab 5 Part 1

I loved Lab 5 Part 1 because it was one of the first times we used if statements. I was familiar with if statements because I used them in my game design class in high school. Since I was a little familiar with if statements, they were pretty fun to code and use on this Lab, and greatly improve my coding skills when using if statements.

* Lab 7 Part 2

Lab 7 Part 2 was a little difficult, I really had a hard time getting it to work because of all the if statements and && in the if statements. Although I had a rough time with this Lab I really improved as a programmer since I had to spend a lot of time fixing some bugs, fixing this if statement and other stuff in the code. This lab really helped me improve my debugging skills.
